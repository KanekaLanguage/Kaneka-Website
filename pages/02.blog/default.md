## A man build session

Last weekend we got together with a group of brilliant hackers to jam on an incredibly engaging project - to build a humanoid robot, and explore the nexus point between our humanity and artificial intelligence.  We made loads of progress and we're really happy with the results both in the software world of sensor integration and interactions and also in the hardware world!!

We fleshed out the implementation of the Kanekan primative "tension" to create an incredible remote tensioning system.  Check out the motors in the following video.
