# The Vision..
#### A standardized set of components that can adapt to build... *anything*

We believe that a standard set of components can come together to compose a world with infinitely **scalable complexity**.  A world of architecture and robotics that suits our human needs.  A unified conceptual framework around the grid structure syntax of Kaneka allows for **unified study and iteration** on mechanical semantics.

We see a world in which universal components are guarantied to be **compatible** with the world around them and that the components are **reusable** when the creation is broken down.


# Mission Statement:
In it's nascent days the focus is on **soft robotics** and **education**.  These applications will be the stepping stone.  We are busy preparing our first robotics kit and partnering with educators.  This is our first mission and current devotion.
