# Mission Statement:

Kaneka is designed to be the **universal build language**.  Think standardization for mechanical structure.  Think functional decomposition down to the most atomic elements of mechanical **semantics**.  This is accomplished by standardizing around a grid structure **syntax** for pieces to come together and relate.  The mission of the Kaneka Language is to create a construction dialect so useful and flexible, that it can apply to any discipline, and that the parts are easy to source because they are standard.

In it's nascent days the focus is on **soft robotics** and **education**.  We are in the process of booting up a kickstarter with our first robotics kit, and partnering with educators to create meaningful and engaging educational challenges.

An ecosystem around the Kaneka Language continues to grow as more and more makers and creators engage with the platform.  This consists of tools for designing parts (check out our fusion360 plugins on github) and a [Library](05.Library) of **modules of functionality** discovered by the userbase (analagous to a library for a programming language).  And a community driven wiki for logging a growing body of theory: [wiki](/04.wiki)
