## First build session

Last weekend we got together with a group of brilliant hackers to jam on a profound and engaging project - to buid a thirty foot tall humanoid robot, and explore the nexus point between our humanity and artificial intelligence.  We made loads of progress and we're really happy with the results both in the software world of sensor integration "the brain" and also in the kanekan world of soft robotics.

We fleshed out the implementation of the Kanekan primative "tension" to create an incredible remote tensioning system.  Check out the motors in the following video.
