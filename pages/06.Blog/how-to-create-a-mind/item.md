## First build session
**Author: Nathan Argetsinger**

I feel blessed that we have had a chance to engage with a particularly special project - the final dream project of Larry Harvey, burning man founder: to build a humanoid robot as the central effigy to Burning Man festival, *The Man*. He thought, as do I, that this would be a good starting point to explore the nexus point between our humanity and artificial intelligence. I believe this is the single most important conversation for Human kind today.

When I heard about this project we had been working on developing Kaneka for about a year and it was the best tool I had to bootstrap the efforts.

As part of the efforts setting this incredible feat up, we've decided to organize three hackathons leading up to the burn to get the community engaged and bootstrap development.  Last weekend was the first of three.

We got together with a group of brilliant hackers to jam.  We made loads of progress and we're really happy with the results both in the software world of sensor integration "the brain" and also in the kanekan world of soft robotics.

When Yush Gupta first confided in me about his build system Kaneka, he told me about his dreams of creating a robotic bird, that could move as smoothly as a real one.  Thus the origins of the organic dreams within the ethos of Kaneka.

I'm really happy with the progress made on that front.  We fleshed out the implementation of the Kanekan primative "tension" to create a remote tensioning system - i.e. tension can be generated anywhere and routed anywhere else.  Check out the motors in the beginning of the highlights video from the hackathon.

This is only the beginning of this incredible Saga, and I'm excited to see how it continues.
